# # ComplianceCheckOut

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**profile** | **string** |  |
**ruleset_version** | **string** | The version these rules came from. Worth recording alongside any document you file — rulesets revise, and &#39;which rules did this pass?&#39; is what an audit asks years later. &#x60;rulesets&#x60; breaks the same answer down per ruleset. |
**valid** | **bool** | Nothing fatal was found. Read it with &#x60;fully_checked&#x60; — on its own it says what was checked came back clean, not that everything was checked. |
**in_scope** | **bool** | Whether any of these rulesets is likely to apply to this document at all. False when neither party is in a country that uses one — these are European e-invoicing rulesets, and for a wholly domestic US invoice, say, &#x60;valid&#x60; is answering a question nobody asked. Advisory: it never changes the verdict or withholds the check, because an open network means a US seller invoicing a Dutch buyer genuinely needs it. | [optional] [default to true]
**fully_checked** | **bool** | Every ruleset that applies to this profile ran. False means at least one could not, and &#x60;rulesets&#x60; says which and why. | [optional] [default to true]
**rulesets** | [**\InvoicePDFs\Model\ComplianceRulesetOut[]**](ComplianceRulesetOut.md) | Every ruleset the document was held to, including the mandatory-field check, at the version that ran. | [optional]
**violations** | [**\InvoicePDFs\Model\ComplianceViolationOut[]**](ComplianceViolationOut.md) | Every violation found, not the first — fixing one field per round trip is the experience this avoids. Ordered mandatory-field findings first, since those name a field you can go and change. | [optional]
